# Electromagnetic Structure Interaction in FEniCS

A computational study by Queiruga and Abali.

## Overview

This repository goes with the paper,

> Abali, B. and A. Queiruga, "Theory and computation of electromagnetic fields and thermomechanical structure interaction for systems undergoing large deformations."

for which the manuscript under review can be found at [https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10551](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10551).

This contains the FEniCS source code for the three problem examples in src. The code has been tested in FEniCS version 2017.1.
